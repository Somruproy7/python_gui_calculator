# python_gui_calculator
Simple gui calculator using pthon tkinter module - here i made this project just to test my knowledge of this programming language. Its basically a simple calculator but the speciality or joy of making this is the interface that pops up which resembles a typical calculator with buttons on it. So beginners can try out this one.
